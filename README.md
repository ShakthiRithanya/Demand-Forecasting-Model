# Demand Forecasting Model

This project aims to build a robust demand forecasting model using various statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation.
- `src/`: Source code for the forecasting models.
- `app/`: Web application for visualizing forecasts.

## Roadmap

1. [x] Data Collection and Generation
2. [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. [ ] Feature Engineering
4. [ ] Baseline Model Implementation
5. [ ] Advanced Statistical Models (ARIMA, SARIMA)
6. [ ] Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
7. [ ] Deep Learning Models (LSTM)
8. [ ] Model Evaluation and Comparison
9. [ ] Dashboard Development
