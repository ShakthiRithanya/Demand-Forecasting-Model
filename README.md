# Demand Forecasting Model

This project aims to build a robust demand forecasting model using various statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation.
- `src/`: Source code for the forecasting models.
- `app/`: Web application for visualizing forecasts.

## Roadmap

1. [x] Data Collection and Generation
2. [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. [x] Feature Engineering
4. [x] Baseline Model Implementation
5. [x] Advanced Statistical Models (ARIMA, SARIMA)
6. [x] Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
7. [x] Deep Learning Models (LSTM)
8. [x] Model Evaluation and Comparison
9. [x] Dashboard Development

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Generate and Preprocess data: `python -m src.pipeline`
3. Run the dashboard: `python app/main.py`
4. Or use Docker: `docker-compose up`
